# The lapidarist* problem

This problem is for you to show your modeling abilities. Bonus points for testing your model’s error using a test set.
The limousine comes to a full stop. As the driver gets out to open the door you take a deep breath and get inside. You enter 10 Downing Street and are conducted to the usual meeting room. Inside you find the Prime Minister, accompanied by a fat, tall man and a short, deform one with long ears and an even longer nose.
* **Prime Minister:**  
 “Ah! You’re here! Great! Let me introduce my guests. This is Fidelious, Minister of Magic, and Krenk, the owner of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank.”
* **You:**  
 “Uhhh, ma’am, is this a joke?”
* **Fidelious:**  
 “Not at all, but don’t worry, don’t sweat the details, tomorrow you won’t remember anything. Security measures, you see.”
* **Krenk:**  
 “Let’s move things along. I don’t like to be exposed to Muggles.”
* **You:**  
 “What...” The Prime Minister interrupts you.
* **Prime Minister:**  
 “Our friends here seem to have run into a bit of an issue, see, some diamonds seem to have been stolen. Problem is, the only person... goblin, sorry“ he says apologetically to Krenk ” to have seen them is our distinguished guest, Krenk.”
* **Fidelious:**  
 “And while the Ministry completely believes Krenk as to the diamonds’ worth, we need another person to validate his claim. Safety policies, you see.”
* **Prime Minister:**  
 “So, since you’re the best data scientist in our country, I thought you could help. Mr. Krenk will provide you with the characteristics of the missing diamonds and we need you to create a model to value them.”
* **You:**  
 “But I’m not a lapidarist.”
* **Prime Minister:**
 “Which is why we’re providing you with a huge dataset, containing characteristics and valuations for tens of thousands of diamonds. Now, get working.“
“Huge? Tens of thousands?“ You think. “And I thought I was the clueless one here.”

Here are the characteristics from Krenk’s diamonds, and a link to the Dataset.
